## Infinite Loop

This is our budgeting software called Infinite Loop!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `src`: The folder that contains all the source code for the application
- `src/Classes`: This subfolder contains the application classes.
- `src/App`: This subfolder contains the entry point of the application
- `lib`: The folder to maintain dependencies

We used `Javadoc` to generate our project documentaion, to view it:
- Navigate to the `docs` folder in our project directory
- Open `index.html` and view it in any web browser

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
